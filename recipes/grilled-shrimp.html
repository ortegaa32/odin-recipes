        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These savory-sweet shrimp skewers are easy to make and cook 
            in just a few minutes. They are perfect for summer weeknights 
            or weekend dinner parties. Prep the sauce ahead of time 
            for an even faster dinner. I prefer to use jumbo shrimp 
            (21 to 25 per pound), however use what you have on hand.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Sauce:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>&frac13; cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh garlic</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>1 pound jumbo shrimp</li>
            <li>&frac12; fresh pineapple, cored and cut into 1 &frac12;-inch pieces</li>
            <li>skewers</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine water, soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, garlic, and 
                ginger in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high 
                heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce 
                has reduced and thickened slightly, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly 
                oil grate. Thread shrimp and pineapple alternately onto 
                skewers and place on a platter.</li>
            <li>Arrange skewers on the hot grate. Grill 2 to 3 minutes per 
                side, or until shrimp is opaque and cooked through. Turn 
                grill to low heat and brush sauce on both sides of skewers. 
                Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle with cilantro 
                and sesame seeds.</li>
        </ol>
